## Hello!
This is my first time setting up a WM without using a preconfigured rice, lol. \
Things are bound to be written poorly or broken but oh well. 

I may end up adding or fixing stuff for a while until life catches up with me again.

## Packages
``` yay -S picom rofi polybar fastfetch feh xfce4-screenshooter rofi-power-menu betterlockscreen ``` 

probably some other stuff i forgot but i'll fix it when / if i remember

## Fonts
- Get the Fonts [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) & [here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.2.1/JetBrainsMono.zip) 
- Move files to ``` ~/.local/share/fonts ```, create if doesn't exist

- Run ```fc-cache -f -v ``` 

- Done

### Fastfetch config

Some stuff contains things from other repos & people. \
I can't remember all the sources for stuff, but I will add them as I rediscover them.
